## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
It is running with Python 3.6 and the following libraries have been included in this project:
* `numpy`
* `pandas`
* `matplotlib`
* `sklearn`

## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
This project consists of 2 parts:
1. Customer Segmentation Report (Unsupervised Learning) - EDA, PCA and clustering analysis of the general and customer population with the goal of being able to describe the core customer base of the company.
2. Predict Customer Report (Supervised Learning) - Use what was observed in part 1 or parts of it to create a supervised learning model that could predict whether an individual would respond to a mail campaign.

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
This project provided by Arvato Financial Solutions was one of the available capstone projects. I chose this project mainly for the reasons, that the data in this project is real and almost no cleaning has been done to it.

## Files <a name="files"></a>
Arvato provided a couple of files for this project but as part of the terms and conditions I'm not allowed to share/include them in this repository. In this repository are only this README file, the terms and conditions statements, the feature_summary.csv, which is necessary for the code and the jupyter notebook Arvato-Project-Workbook.ipynb

## Results <a name="results"></a>
See blog post [here](https://medium.com/@michael.heroth/customer-segmentation-report-for-arvato-financial-services-39d9f603e1ab) 

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
I would like to thank Arvato Financial Solutions for the datasets/files and Udacity for making this project possible.
